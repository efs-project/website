        <h2>Project overview</h2>
        <p>EFS provides a schelling point for on-chain data and information.</p>
        <p>EFS is an uncensorable shared file system powered by immutable smart contracts that are deployable to any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain. The data is stored as a labeled property graph with nodes (e.g. addresses, contracts, DAOs, knowledge graph data) providing a versatile Key=Value list of information for others to view. Nodes can also have relationships (directed graph edges) with other nodes such as "subdirectory_of", "follows", and "comments".</p>
        <p>Users can view EFS data via an immutable html/js/css progressive web app File Browser hosted on IPFS (and easily accessible via https://browse.evmfs.eth.limo). Applications can access the data through the EFS smart contract, The Graph, locally hosted nodes, etc.</p>
        <h2>EFS's core features include:</h2>
        <dl>
            <dt>Topics</dt>
            <dd>
                A common place where users can attach relevant data about things, events, ideas, file hashes, etc. These are well known strings that can be used as a schelling point for easily discovering relevant information about something.
            </dd>
            <dt>Editions</dt>
            <dd>
                Provides the censorship resistence of EFS by allowing each user to provide their own version of the data for a topic.
            </dd>
            <dt>Hierarchical structure</dt>
            <dd>
                Nodes maintain a hierarchical structure similar to directories and subdirectories. Child nodes control their own data but may delegate some of their configuration to their parent node.
            </dd>
